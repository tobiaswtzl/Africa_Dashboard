# Africa_Dashboard

This Dashboard visualises data from various sources for the Africa DG of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Since the (financial) data is confidential, the data is not uploaded on GitHub. The Dashboard consists of two parts:

## Current Situation

This part of the dashboard provides an overview about the current situation in Africa visualising the current level of hunger, food prices, internal displacement, violence, protests and number of people affected by natural disasters. 

## Bilateral Development Aid to Africa

The amount of German bilateral development aid to African countries is visualised and disaggregated by Kernthema, Referat (Division) and feminist component.
