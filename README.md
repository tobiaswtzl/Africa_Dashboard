# Africa_Dashboard

This dashboard visualises data from various sources for the Africa Directorate-General of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). As the (financial) data is confidential, the data is not uploaded to GitHub. The dashboard consists of two parts:

## Current Situation

This part of the dashboard provides an overview of the current situation in Africa, showing the current status of hunger, food prices, internal displacement, violence, protests and the number of people affected by natural disasters.

## Bilateral Development Aid to Africa

The amount of German bilateral development aid to African countries is visualised and disaggregated by Kernthema, Referat (Division) and feminist component.

## Manual

To run the app, you just have to run the global.R file (assuming you have the data).
